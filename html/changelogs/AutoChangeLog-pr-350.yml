changes:
  - bugfix: "Fix robotic organs to not gain health passively, from revival, smart organ fridge, pluxium, occuline, and earmuffs."
  - rscadd: "Some diseases now require the appropriate internal organ to work. A robotic organ will give immunity to the disease symptom unless the disease has \"Inorganic Biology\"."
  - rscadd: "Disease transmission methods now require an internal organ to be successful. Robotic organs give immunity. (except inorganic biology) Airborne disease transmission require lungs. Ingested (drunk or eaten) disease transmission requires a stomach. Blood (inject or patch) disease transmission requires a heart."
  - rscadd: "Organs removed from a mob that is afflicted with a disease will be infectious while handling or transplanting it. (again, robotic organs are immune unless inorganic biology is present) Certain admin spawned or special diseases are exempt from this transmission method."
  - rscadd: "A stomach is required for nebula nausea, gastritium, carpellosis, metabolic boost, vomit, weight loss, death sandwich poisoning"
  - rscadd: "Lungs are required for choking, asphyxiation, cough, cold9, oxygen restoration, sneezing, flu, cold, spanish flu, tuberculosis"
  - rscadd: "A liver is required for tissue hydration, plasma fixation, parasitic infection"
  - rscadd: "Ears are required for deafness, sensory restoration add: A heart is required for toxolysis, heart failure add: Eyes are required for sensory restoration, hyphema"
  - rscadd: "A tongue is required for voice change, pierrot throat bal: Remove head requirement for wizarditis disease /"
  - code_imp: "Synth organs take EMP damage"
  - rscadd: "Synth organs can be printed and replaced"
  - bugfix: "Synth EMP damage is normalized again\n:cl:"
